# pi_video_looper
Fork note: The exact same thing as Adafruit, but for a particular reason, I needed the "disable" keystroke to be Space.
Original: Application to turn your Raspberry Pi into a dedicated looping video playback device, good for art installations, information displays, or just playing cat videos all day.
